# Synopsis

The whole idea for this meme generator project came from sourcing a number of ineteresting posts I've observed in data science community over the past year where a new data scientist position is posted, and/or an article is shared on medium, kdnuggets or elsewhere, and for some reason Venn Diagrams came into focus used heavily and abused for that purpose.

As a data viz specialist and practitioner, I had it, and me and a few other creative types decided if we can't beat them, we should join them and create one stop shop app for you to gen those Venn Diagrams about what you fancy and what unicorn intersection you are trying to find FTW.

Thus, the Venn Diagram meme generator idea was born:

Ideally, we'd like to create an app for you to gen Venn Diagrams like this:
